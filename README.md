# Milab-Sticky
IoT program for smart nightlight that encourages long-term hobby engagement in children.
The ESP32 tracks button presses as milestones in a child’s offline hobby activity. 
Each press triggers LED animations and a timed servo movement. After six presses, 
the device activates a full celebration mode with dynamic LED effects.
